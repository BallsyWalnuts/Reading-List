## Epistle of Mathetes to Diognetus

- Could ch. 4 be an early attestation to the Christian Church *not* following a church calendar like a majority of the church does today?

  > As for the minute way [the Jews] scrutinize the moon and the stars for the purpose of ritually commemorating months and days, and chop up the divinely appointed cycle of seasons to suit their own fancies, pronouncing some to be times for feasting and others for mourning -- could anyone pretend that this indicates true reverence, and not simply a deranged intellect?
