# My Reading List

## About

This repo contains a running list of all the books that I have read. 

The list, as it currently stands, will list books by the year that I read them, and then by genre. Included with each book is a rating out of 5 stars. At some point in the future, I would probably like to include notes on significant books, but we shall see.
