# My Reading List

## About

This repo contains a running list of all the books that I have read.

The list, as it currently stands, will list books by the year that I read them, and then by genre. Included with each book is a rating out of 5 stars. At some point in the future, I would probably like to include notes on significant books, but we shall see.

My general interests are Christian theology, cultural commentary, poetry, and historical fiction, so those may be seen the most on the list, but I am willing to read in just about any genre, so we will see where this goes. Tastes change over time too, so I really have no idea what will pique my interest in the future.
